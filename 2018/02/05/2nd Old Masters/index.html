				<h2><strong>From da Vinci to Michelangelo&#58 is Old Master Still in Favor?</strong></h2>
				<div><p>December 17, 2017</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:600px;margin-bottom: -20px;" src="/img/old_master/old3.jpg"><p class="img-description">Leonardo da Vinci, <em>Salvator Mundi</em>, circa 1500.</p></div>

<p>Da Vinci’s <em>Salvator Mundi</em> made an auction record at Christie’s Postwar and Contemporary sale. The media coverage about the painting has been massive so far: its history, the lawsuits surrounding it, its secret buyer, among many other stories. The attention and money that <em>Salvator Mundi</em> has garnered are enormous. Though I am not sure if people care more about da Vinci’s art or the record-breaking price, I am still thrilled that an Old Master painting finally became a headline in the contemporary-minded art world.</p>
<p>Old Masters refers to a group of European painters working before around 1800. It is said the market interest in Old Masters has declined, evidenced by approximately 5% market share across all categories of artwork. The Old Masters’ market has been stagnant for a while; varied sources of market analysis often say the market taste has changed.   In contrast to the da Vinci frenzy, the London’s Old Masters Week in early December showed us the market reality: five sales by Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Bonhams combined realized just £58.2 million, with a Titan’s portrait (est. £1 - 1.5 million, US$1.3 - 2 million) failing to sell. The money amassed  from all sales of Old Master paintings might not beat a sought-after contemporary painting. However, the result is considered solid – 48.5% increase compared to last winter. </p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:400px;margin-bottom: -20px;" src="/img/old_master/old1.jpg"><p class="img-description">Part of Michelangelo’s <em>Drapery Study for the Erythraean Sibyl on the Sistine Ceiling</em></p></div>

<p>Coincidently, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is currently staging an exhibition, <em>Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer</em>, which features Michelangelo’s drawings and sculptures. This collection attracts big crowds to the MET. <a href="https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/michelangelo-met-logistics-1176644" target="_blank" rel="external">A news report from Artnet</a> names it a “landmark show” given the difficulties in bringing together more than 200 original works from over 50 institutions (Henri Neuendorf). Many works are important in both Michelangelo’s body of work and art history. </p>
<p>Both da Vinci and Michelangelo raise the same question: has people’s taste really changed as the market reports claim?</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:600px;margin-bottom: -20px;" src="/img/old_master/old2.jpg"><p class="img-description">Anselm Kiefer, <em>Morgenthau Plan</em>, 2012. Acrylic, emulsion, oil, and shellac on inkjet prints mounted on canvas. The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p></div>

<p>After viewing Michelangelo’s exhibition, I visited a new space in the MET which boasts contemporary art from some of the most renowned artists in the 20th century. Stellar names like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Anselm Kiefer, to name just a few, have always been favored by the art market. But the large-scale contemporary works housed in the MET’s bright and spacious galleries do not seem to appeal to many visitors. People prefer to go for the small, monochromic and even discolored drawings of Michelangelo in the dimly-lit and crowded galleries. This comparison might not be fair since many people are not aware of this hidden space for contemporary art in the MET. But my take on da Vinci and Michelangelo is that aside from the contemporary-minded art world, the public still show great interests in the Old Masters. </p>
<p>The art market unveils our taste in some way, but it certainly does not speak for all of us. The booming contemporary art market is complicated: it involves many hidden financial arrangements and marketing strategies other than just aesthetic values and market taste. Many hedge fund managers, banks and mega gallerists participate in the art market for financial gains. When telephone-number prices for contemporary art hit our nerves every now and then, we almost believe that economic values determine the public’s taste; in other words, being marketable is equivalent to being valuable.</p>
<p>In a recent study of the Jews in Michelangelo’s art, I found below thought-provoking quote: <em>“who gets to decide what is noble, and what guarantees that this decision will be just, or fair? The voices of the powerful are always the loudest. If, as it has often been said, history is written by the winners, in too many scenarios we are certainly missing the objective truth; at the very least, we are lacking a side to the story.”</em> (Chantal Sulkow).</p>
<p>Art has become an asset class; and contemporary art is the most profitable category among all. If the winners in the commercial art world are those who profit the most, contemporary art certainly draws the most attention. The polarization of wealth and the power of money overshadows another side of history which is written by art scholars, collectors and the public, among many others. The winners are the loudest, but they are not necessarily the taste arbitrators.</p>
