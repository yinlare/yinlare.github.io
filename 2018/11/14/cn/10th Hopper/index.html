				<h2><strong>Why is Hopper's New Auction Record Frivolous</strong></h2>
				<div><p>Nov 14, 2018</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:600px;margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/img/Hopper/p1.png"></div>

<p>I always wanted to write about Edward Hopper, but I never figured out how to start. Hopper has long been one of my favorite artists. He is somewhere between a household name and a lesser-known artist. Many people know him, but not many talk about him. Many museums collect his works, but few art historians seriously write about him. He remains a bit mysterious as those lonely figures in his paintings.</p>
<p>Things changed a couple of months ago when Christie’s announced that one of Hopper’s masterpieces, <em>Chop Suey</em> (1929), would be auctioned this November. I was excited about the news at first as Hopper’s oil paintings are rarely seen at auctions, especially a work of such significance. But then Christie’s started this huge market campaign of this work-a global tour and a big presence on both traditional and social media (sounds familiar right? Think about that record-breaking <em>Salvador Mundi</em>). Hopper became a marketable name all of a sudden, and of course the work is the cover lot of the auction <strong><em>An American Place | The Barney A. Ebsworth Collection Evening Sale</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Hopper has been over-hyped in the past few months - an artist who even barely talked about his works. I definitely have mixed feelings about all the publicity. On one hand, it does make Hopper more well-known to the general public, probably to the people who are not that familiar with American realist artists. On the other hand, I act like a kid who doesn’t want to share the favorite toy with others. Most importantly, Hopper’s paintings never tend to be showy. </p>
<p>I don’t remember since when seeing Hopper’s works became a pilgrimage; I try to find all his works from one museum to another. Like artists have personalities, I think so do their works. Hopper’s art never tries to advertise anything: oftentimes it delineates an anonymous person in a place that could be anywhere. And the melancholy and solitude disseminated from his art always make me contemplate. “Mindfulness” is a word that is probably overused today, yet Hoppers’ works do make me mindful - it is about learning to keep inner peace when you live in a chaotic world where solitude is always part of your life. I like to spend time staring at his paintings - it’s a therapeutic experience. However, seeing the massive publicity of Hopper’s masterpiece, I feel that an old friend is being misrepresented and misunderstood.</p>
<p>The auction just ended. <em>Chop Suey</em> was hammered at 85 million US dollars, a new auction record for the artist. Another work by Hopper, <em>Cottage at North Truro</em> (1938) was sold at 2.9 million US dollars, net of buyer’s premium. They both achieved financial successes.</p>
<p>I always consider myself “liberal” in terms of how I view the art market, maybe partly due to my banking background. Money always matters, right? But first time, I started thinking what those marketing campaigns mean to a broader audience - do they really help us learn about an artist and his or her works? Art auction is a pure business. Everything an auction house does is about promoting the artworks for sale. We are used to the frothy contemporary art market where every artist is presented as a celebrity, so it is okay. But when it comes to one of my favorites, I find it is actually NOT okay.</p>
<p><em>Chop Suey</em> fetched almost 100 million US dollars today (approx. USD 92M with buyer’s premium). If there is a 100 million club in the art world, you might see Picasso, Warhol or Basquiat. I honestly don’t know how Hopper can fit in there.</p>
<p>Well, luckily the show is over; and the curtain is falling. I’m relieved.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:600px;margin-bottom: -20px;" src="/img/Hopper/p2.jpg"><p class="img-description">Hopper’s most famous work, <em>The Nighthawks</em>. I first saw a copy of this work when I first moved to Canada for school. I was appealed to the sense of isolation and solitude in this work. When I visited Chicago in 2008, Art Institute of Chicago was staging Hopper’s retrospective. Now this painting is being loaned to Shanghai Museum for the special exhibition <em>Pathways to Modernism American Art, 1865-1945</em>.</p></div>
