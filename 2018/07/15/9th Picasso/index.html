				<h2><strong>What Picasso's Stellar Work Inspires Us</strong></h2>

<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:600px;margin-bottom: 20px;" src="/img/Picasso/p1.jpg"></div>

<p>Art historian, Bendor Grosvenor, wrote an article for <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/comment/do-not-allow-art-to-cleanse-crimes" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>The Art Newspaper</em></a>. He scrutinizes our humanity through Picasso’s $115M painting, <em>Fillette à la corbeille fleurie</em> (<em>Young Girl with a Flower Basket</em>, 1905), in the stellar Rockefeller sale at Christie’s New York this May. </p>
<p>I find Grosvenor’s punchline fascinating: “<em>I’m not in favour of judging the past by contemporary standards, but we allow art to cleanse even the worst crimes. We shouldn’t.</em>“ The Picasso painting unveils that when money meets morals, money prevails. I get it, it’s a Picasso: his prominence in art history outweighs his flaws; and his market has always been robust. On the other hand, Chuck Close is not that lucky-his exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. was called off due to his sexual misconduct. Also, his works have evaporated in the market since then. But it raises a question: do we care about humanity or the market more? After Picasso, shall we applause for the victory over Close’s show? My take from Picasso’s sale is that there are many factors in driving an artwork’s price, obviously the moral standard is not the dominant one. </p>
<p>Grosvenor also brings up the question that I have been thinking for long: shall we judge people in the past by contemporary values?  It reminds me of a dialogue on Valentine’s Day; my friend and I in particular focused on feminism-a topic that has been argued by many female art historians in the past few decades. It turned out to be the best and most thought-provoking Valentine conversation I had ever had. </p>
<p>I once did a research on the trajectory of Gauguin’s critical reception from feminist standpoint. Honestly, I don’t find it fair to dig into artists’ anecdotes 100 years ago and blame them for treating women like sexual objects. Gauguin went to Tahiti and painted aboriginal women there. Yes, those young women might have been his mistresses, and the fact he lived in a remote island mystifies his works.  When some female historians accuse that Gauguin is a misogynist, I wonder if this critique is that relevant? It will not change the fact that Gauguin is one of the best artists in art history, and from a humanitarian perspective, is the artist even able to defend himself? </p>
<p>I’m not here to against feminism; I am against taking any fact to a moral level. An organization for women in arts is conducting a survey on women’s salaries-a hot topic relating to gender inequality. I discussed the survey with an acquaintance who sits on the steering committee of the organization. I was quite blunt to say this salary issue has been over-rated, in my opinion. I sensed that she was a bit defended by my view. I understand that we need some solid numbers to justify the gender inequality, but gender inequality is just a fact. Why do we need extra numbers to prove it, let alone statistics themselves can have many problems? </p>
<p>We should fight for equality. Feminist movements have made women more empowered and courageous than ever. Unfortunately, the notion of feminism is improperly used oftentimes. After many struggles and debates, there has never been an effective solution to tackle the problem of gender inequality so far. When the outcomes have not met our expectations, shall we acknowledge the result and better our approaches?</p>
<p>Linda Nochlin, one of the most renowned feminist art historians in our time, once said “<em>I feel that in some sense, all my work is provisional: that is to say, while I believe in it very strongly, I still remain open to what I hear, learn, and experience. I see it very much as a dialectic, a cooperative experience. Feminist art history-like feminism itself-is a product of give and take, talking and listening.</em>“ </p>
<p>Fight wisely. </p>
