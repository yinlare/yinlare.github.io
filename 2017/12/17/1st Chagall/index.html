		<h2><strong>Why did Chagall’s <i>Les Mariés</i> Fail to Sell in Shanghai</strong></h2>
		<p><p>November 5, 2017</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><br><img style="width:400px;margin-bottom: -20px;" src="/img/les-maries.jpg"><br><p style="font-size:14px;margin-bottom:15px">Chagall, <i>Les Mariés</i> (1979). Photo source: Christie’s.</p><br></div>

<p>I just finished my thesis about Chagall’s market, collectors and symbols. During my research, I found that the cover lot of Christie’s 20th Century &amp; Contemporary Art evening sale in Shanghai, <em>Les Mariés</em> (1979), failed to find a buyer. I was astounded - according to my research the market demand for Chagall’s paintings has been high historically. The pre-sale media campaign  made <em>Les Mariés</em> the focus of this sale. So why did it fail to sell?</p>
<p>Before talking about why, I list several common characteristics of an expensive Chagall’s painting on the auction market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medium: oil on canvas</li>
<li>Motif: bouquets and flying lovers</li>
<li>Size: the larger the better</li>
<li>Year: works which produced before 1941 are more sought-after (because Chagall painted more after 1941); the works painted between the 1910s and the 1940s have realized great market success. The works in a specific year can be exceptionally expensive; for example the quantity of paintings produced in 1928 is very small thus they are more coveted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at this <em>Les Mariés</em>. The price is estimated between US$ 2.5 – 3.5 million. It’s a tempera-on-masonite executed in the artist’s later years – 1979. These could be deal breakers for a top lot Chagall. Chagall is well known as a prolific artist; that means the market supply of his paintings is high. For Modern masters, oil paintings are usually more sought-after and more expensive than a similar painting in other mediums. Even the signature flowers and lovers in Les Mariés are not among the most impressive. Looking at the most expensive works sold on auctions, the market loves enlarged bouquets dominating the canvas, giving spectators sumptuous and mystical sensation. </p>
<p>Here is the question: why would a collector want to pay US$ 2.5 – 3.5 million for a mediocre Chagall painting? It is not a rare work: not the best year; not the best medium; boring provenance and no exhibition history. It is certainly not a starry work from Chagall. Meanwhile, the Chinese market for Impressionist and Modern art might be over-estimated.  Chinese collectors are expected to repeat the Impressionist boom that Japanese created in the 1990s, especially with the story of Modigliani’s <em>Reclining Nude</em>. After knowing that this top lot failed to sell, I sense that Chinese collectors are informed and sensible. And don’t forget, if this painting was sold and eventually imported into China, 17% VAT would be added on top of the hammer price and buyer’s premium.</p>

<p>Market mechanism is hard to fully understand. But after all, the market always favors rare works. In a recent auction at Sotheby’s New York, Chagall’s <em>Portrait de la Soeur de L’artiste</em> (1908) fetched US$ 852,500. That was the first time I saw a Chagall’s painting at auction which was executed before 1910. The motif, Chagall’s unrefined skill in his early career and the small size (25 x 21 in. 63.5 x 53.3 cm) of this work are definitely not the most favorable by collectors, but the realized price still hit almost a million.</p>
<p>If a paintings isn’t that special and the market doesn’t overheat, I am not surprised that a Chagall fails to sell. But when it comes to a cover lot, I wonder if it is a failure of the sales team.</p>
